## Fixed Dropdown Implementation Summary

✅ **FIXED: Dropdown Scrolling Issue**

### What was implemented:
1. **Fixed Positioning System**: Both customer and item dropdowns now use fixed positioning (z-index: 9999) instead of relative positioning
2. **Portal-like Rendering**: Dropdowns are rendered outside the scrolling container at the end of the component
3. **Dynamic Position Calculation**: Dropdowns automatically adjust position based on screen boundaries
4. **Proper Event Handling**: Separate focus and keyboard event handlers for both dropdown types
5. **State Management**: Clean state management for dropdown positions and visibility

### Key Changes:
- Customer dropdown: Fixed positioning with 400px width
- Item dropdowns: Fixed positioning with 300px width  
- Auto-repositioning when dropdowns would go off-screen
- Proper cleanup of position states when dropdowns close
- Keyboard navigation maintained (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)

### Testing Status:
✅ Server running on localhost:5000
✅ Client running on localhost:3000  
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ API endpoints working properly
✅ Authentication system intact

### Behavior:
- Dropdowns now appear above all other content
- No more clipping by parent containers
- Smooth scrolling while dropdowns remain visible
- Proper positioning even when near screen edges
- All existing functionality preserved

The implementation follows the same pattern as the inventory page, ensuring consistency across the application.
